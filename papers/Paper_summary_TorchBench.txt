what are the main advantages of torchbench

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

TorchBench has several key advantages that make it a strong choice for benchmarking PyTorch performance:

1. Broad PyTorch API Coverage

2.3× more API coverage than MLPerf – TorchBench includes 84 models across six domains (CV, NLP, recommendation, RL, speech, others), ensuring that a wide range of PyTorch operators and execution paths are tested.

This exposes performance bugs that narrower suites miss — e.g., identifying 10× slowdowns in quantized models due to inefficient error handling in torch.ops

2304.14226v3

.

2. Representative and Diverse Model Selection

Includes classic, popular, and industry-important models like ResNet, Detectron2, BERT, T5, YOLO, and DLRM, as well as recent diffusion models and RL tasks.

Covers models with different architectures, layer types, and workloads, allowing fair performance characterization across domains

2304.14226v3

.

3. Fine-Grained and Fair Benchmarking

Focuses on computation-heavy segments of models (excluding data loading and checkpointing) for consistent and reproducible measurements.

Tunes batch sizes and precision (FP32/TF32) for each model to maximize GPU utilization and enable meaningful comparisons

2304.14226v3

.

4. Deep Insights into PyTorch Performance

Provides detailed execution time breakdowns (GPU active, data movement, GPU idle) to pinpoint bottlenecks — e.g., showing GPUs are idle ~44% of training time on average.

Enables comparisons across compilers (TorchDynamo + TorchInductor vs. eager) and hardware platforms (NVIDIA vs. AMD), giving actionable insights for optimization

2304.14226v3

.

5. Practical Impact on PyTorch Ecosystem

TorchBench has been integrated into PyTorch CI, catching regressions daily.

Led to performance bug fixes and optimizations that were upstreamed, with speedups up to 10× on some models (e.g., pig2, hf_reformer)

2304.14226v3

.

6. Extensibility and Tooling

Ships with built-in tools for configuration, metric collection, and CI integration, making it easy to adopt and maintain.

Continues to evolve to support end-to-end models and other frameworks (e.g., JAX)

2304.14226v3

.

Would you like me to make a comparison table showing TorchBench vs. other benchmark suites like MLPerf and Fathom, so you can see where it stands out most?

* * *

**You:**

is it only pytorch models

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Not strictly — but TorchBench was originally designed specifically for PyTorch.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Primary Focus: PyTorch

The benchmark was created to characterize the performance of the PyTorch software stack, including models, the framework, and GPU libraries.

It is used by the PyTorch team for performance debugging, regression detection, and CI integration, so nearly all included models are PyTorch implementations

2304.14226v3

.

2. Evolution Beyond PyTorch

The paper notes that TorchBench has started to evolve to:

Include end-to-end models (not just sliced computation-heavy segments).

Support frameworks beyond PyTorch, such as JAX.

This multi-framework support is still in a preliminary stage and was outside the main scope of the paper

2304.14226v3

.

Summary

Right now: TorchBench is still mostly PyTorch models and is primarily a PyTorch-focused benchmark.

Future direction: It is becoming more general, aiming to benchmark multiple frameworks, but this is early and experimental.

Would you like me to list some non-PyTorch support efforts (like which models have been ported to JAX or ONNX) so you can see how cross-framework benchmarking might work with TorchBench?

* * *

**You:**

they only focus on core computation, did they not care about ttft

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good observation — you’re right that TorchBench focuses on the core computation phase, not end-to-end latency metrics like time-to-first-token (TTFT).

Here’s how they frame it:

1. Scope of TorchBench

Focus on computation-heavy regions:

They slice model code to measure only the GPU-intensive sections — e.g., forward/backward passes — and exclude data loading, preprocessing, checkpointing, and distributed setup

2304.14226v3

.

This choice ensures reproducibility and isolates compute efficiency (TFLOPS, GPU utilization) from I/O noise.

Batch size & precision tuning:

They carefully choose batch sizes and precision (FP32/TF32) to maximize GPU utilization and measure peak compute throughput

2304.14226v3

.

2. Implications for TTFT

TTFT is not explicitly measured.

TTFT is dominated by prefill latency, data movement, and kernel launch overhead — some of which TorchBench indirectly exposes (e.g., GPU idle time, data movement fraction) but does not report as an end-to-end latency metric.

The suite’s main metrics are execution time for a single iteration, GPU/CPU memory use, and breakdown of active/idle time

2304.14226v3

.

Goal is system characterization, not user latency.

The intent is to find framework inefficiencies (e.g., kernel fusion opportunities, error-handling overhead) rather than measure real-world response latency as a user would experience it.

3. Why This Makes Sense

TTFT can be influenced by many non-framework factors (I/O pipeline, batching, network latency), so it’s hard to attribute regressions to PyTorch itself.

TorchBench’s focus is to make PyTorch faster at what it controls — the compute phase, which indirectly benefits TTFT by reducing kernel launch overhead and GPU idle time.

So in short: no, they didn’t explicitly target TTFT, but their work on improving kernel fusion, reducing GPU idleness, and lowering CPU-GPU data transfer overheads will help lower TTFT indirectly.

Would you like me to outline how one could extend TorchBench to measure TTFT or end-to-end latency (e.g., by adding prefill measurement for LLMs)?

* * *

**You:**

how do they consider compiler performance of different models

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — TorchBench does a systematic, model-by-model evaluation of compiler performance, rather than just looking at aggregate speedups.

Here’s how they approach it:

1. Multiple Compiler Backends

TorchBench compares different PyTorch execution modes:

Eager mode (default interpreter)

TorchScript (classic JIT tracing)

Torch-TensorRT (Ahead-of-Time compiler)

TorchDynamo + TorchInductor (graph capture + Triton kernel generation)
They use TorchInductor as the main representative for compiler-based execution since it’s the recommended PyTorch 2.0 backend

2304.14226v3

.

2. Per-Model Measurement

For each model in the benchmark suite, they measure:

Execution time (speedup/slowdown relative to eager mode)

CPU memory consumption

GPU memory consumption

They report geomean speedups (1.30× for training, 1.46× for inference with TorchInductor on average) but also plot per-model bars so you can see which models benefit more or less

2304.14226v3

.

3. Insights & Observations

Most models speed up under TorchInductor thanks to:

Kernel fusion (removing intermediate loads/stores)

Graph-level scheduling (better node ordering)

Buffer reuse (reduces CPU memory footprint)

2304.14226v3

But GPU memory usage increases significantly (31–51% on average, sometimes >5×), which can make certain models infeasible on small GPUs.

Outlier cases:

Models like YOLOv3 and hf_Reformer actually slow down because of JIT compilation overhead and thousands of guard checks in TorchInductor, which are expensive at runtime

2304.14226v3

.

4. Practical Impact

These results are used to:

Identify which models regress when compiled.

Guide compiler developers (e.g., TorchInductor team) to optimize graph capture and reduce guard overhead.

Help users decide when to enable compilation (e.g., good for long-running training loops, not always worth it for short inference jobs).

Summary

TorchBench doesn’t just report one number — it provides a model-by-model view of compiler effects, showing speedup, CPU/GPU memory trade-offs, and outliers. This makes it valuable for both framework developers and production engineers deciding how to deploy models.

Would you like me to summarize this in a table format, showing what TorchBench measures per model and what insights it produces (e.g., speedup, memory trade-offs, JIT overhead)? That might make it easier to present.

**You:**

Where has torchbench been used

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

TorchBench has already been used in multiple real-world settings, both by researchers and by the PyTorch team itself. Here’s where it shows up:

1. PyTorch Performance Optimization

Guiding bug fixes and kernel optimizations:

TorchBench profiling revealed issues like:

GPU idleness in optimizer.zero_grad() (fixed with torch._foreach_zero_ for fused zeroing)

Unnecessary CPU-GPU copies in hf_reformer (fixed by switching to CPU computation for scalar rsqrt)

Inefficient memory offloading in pig2 (added option to disable offload on large-memory GPUs)

These patches were upstreamed into PyTorch and model repos, yielding up to 10× speedups in some cases

2304.14226v3

.

2. PyTorch Continuous Integration (CI)

Daily regression detection:

TorchBench is integrated into PyTorch’s GitHub Actions CI to run performance checks on:

Training + inference

CPU-only + CPU+GPU modes

Execution time + peak memory usage

If a commit causes >7% slowdown or memory bloat, CI automatically files a GitHub issue tagging the commit

2304.14226v3

.

Impact:

Caught 7 major regressions — five commits were reverted, two were fixed with optimization patches.

Examples include template mismatches (causing 24× inference slowdown), redundant validity checks, and misconfigured cuBLAS memory management

2304.14226v3

.

3. Research & Evaluation

Used in the TorchInductor evaluation (PyTorch 2.0 release) to show:

1.30× training and 1.46× inference speedups on average compared to eager mode.

Significant CPU memory savings (71–74%) but GPU memory increase (31–51%)

2304.14226v3

.

Used to compare hardware platforms:

NVIDIA A100 vs. AMD MI210 — showed that performance advantage depends on precision (TF32 vs. FP32) and operator mix

2304.14226v3

.

4. Ecosystem Adoption

TorchBench is open-source and continues to evolve.

It has been picked up by framework developers and performance engineers to:

Benchmark across releases,

Evaluate compilers (TorchDynamo, TorchInductor),

Stress-test GPU libraries like cuDNN and ROCm

2304.14226v3

.

Summary

TorchBench isn’t just a research artifact — it’s actively used to:
✅ Detect and fix regressions in PyTorch CI
✅ Guide optimizations in the PyTorch framework & model repos
✅ Evaluate compilers and hardware backends
✅ Serve as a reproducible benchmarking suite for researchers and engineers

Would you like me to pull some specific examples of GitHub issues or PRs that TorchBench flagged (e.g., PR numbers, slowdown factors) so you can cite them directly?

* * *

**You:**

what are the main competitors to torchbench? and who is doing the best currentlt

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good question — TorchBench isn’t the only deep learning benchmark suite, but it’s quite unique in its focus. Let’s break it down:

1. Main Competitors to TorchBench
Benchmark Suite	Focus	Strengths	Weaknesses (vs. TorchBench)
MLPerf (Training + Inference)	Industry-standard benchmark suite (Google, NVIDIA, Meta, etc. are contributors)	Highly standardized, compares frameworks + hardware; tracks SOTA submissions; widely recognized in ML industry	Very small model set (8 models); designed for framework/hardware comparison, not for PyTorch-specific bug hunting; limited PyTorch API coverage

2304.14226v3


DAWNBench (Stanford)	End-to-end time-to-accuracy & cost-to-accuracy	Focuses on real-world training efficiency and cost-effectiveness	Mostly outdated (no longer maintained); limited model variety
AIBench	Full-stack AI benchmarking (data center + edge)	Covers a wide range of AI tasks (training + inference)	End-to-end only, not deep on PyTorch internal profiling
Fathom / DeepBench / DNNMark	Microbenchmarks for operators	Good for isolated kernel performance analysis	Not representative of real models; no continuous integration or regression detection
Hugging Face Leaderboards (e.g. Open LLM Leaderboard)	LLM evaluation	Strong for task-level performance, leaderboard tracking	Not about runtime/system performance — focuses on accuracy/metrics, not execution profiling
2. Who Is “Doing the Best” Right Now

It depends on what “best” means — but for PyTorch ecosystem performance characterization, TorchBench is arguably the leader:

Coverage & Depth:

Covers 84 models and 2.3× more PyTorch API surface than MLPerf

2304.14226v3

.

Includes computation-only profiling to isolate GPU inefficiencies (GPU idleness, data movement).

Real-World Impact:

Directly integrated into PyTorch CI, catching regressions daily.

Multiple upstream performance fixes and optimizations have come because of TorchBench findings

2304.14226v3

.

Research Utility:

Actively used to evaluate TorchInductor/TorchDynamo and compare GPU hardware platforms (NVIDIA vs AMD).

For cross-framework, cross-hardware comparisons, MLPerf is still the gold standard — it’s what hardware vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Google, etc.) use to publish performance numbers. But for making PyTorch faster, TorchBench is currently the most practical and widely adopted tool.

Summary

If your goal is framework + hardware comparison: MLPerf is still the industry benchmark.

If your goal is PyTorch-specific performance tuning, regression detection, and CI integration: TorchBench is best-in-class right now — no other suite offers the same depth of PyTorch API coverage or CI integration.

Would you like me to create a visual chart (like a quadrant plot) showing TorchBench vs. MLPerf vs. DAWNBench (dimensions: framework coverage vs. PyTorch focus)? It could be a nice way to show “who’s best” depending on use case.

According to this paper why is trust considered so important in ML applications

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

According to the paper, trust is considered crucial in ML applications because it directly affects whether people will actually use, rely on, and benefit from machine learning models. The authors argue that trust plays a central role in decision-making systems since end-users often interact with ML models as “black boxes” and must decide how much to rely on their predictions

accuracy

.

Here are the key reasons the paper highlights why trust is so important:

1. ML Is Increasingly Used for High-Stakes Decisions

Machine learning is applied in medicine, public policy, criminal justice, and welfare systems — contexts where decisions can have major personal or societal consequences. If users don’t trust models, they may ignore useful predictions, but if they trust them too much, they may follow them even when they are wrong

accuracy

.

2. Users Lack Direct Visibility Into Model Internals

Because ML models are often opaque, users rely on proxy signals like stated accuracy on held-out data to decide whether to trust them. If this information is misleading (e.g., if real-world data distribution shifts), users could overtrust or undertrust, leading to poor decision outcomes

accuracy

.

3. Trust Shapes Human-Machine Collaboration

The paper shows experimentally that trust affects how often people change their own predictions to match the model’s prediction (“switch fraction”) and how much confidence they report. If trust is miscalibrated — either too high or too low — it can undermine effective human-AI collaboration

accuracy

.

4. Communicating Performance and Uncertainty is Critical

The authors emphasize that designers must responsibly communicate model performance and uncertainty, because this shapes trust before and after users observe model behavior in practice. Trust that is too low leads to under-utilization, while trust that is too high can be dangerous if the model makes errors or fails in edge cases

accuracy

.

In summary, trust is not just a “soft” factor — it is a determinant of whether ML systems will be adopted and used appropriately. The paper frames trust calibration (matching the user’s trust level to the model’s actual performance) as essential for safe and effective deployment of ML systems.

Would you like me to summarize how their experiments measured trust (behavioral vs. self-reported metrics) and what they found about how accuracy influences trust levels? That gives a fuller picture of why trust matters so much.

* * *

**You:**

Why is trust considered so important in Machine Learning applications?  
*
1 point
Because ML models always provide perfect predictions.
Because users need to balance reliance on ML with their own judgment.
Because trust ensures models are technically accurate.
Because without trust, ML models cannot be deployed.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct answer is:

✅ Because users need to balance reliance on ML with their own judgment.

Trust is important because it determines whether people will rely on the model appropriately — neither ignoring helpful predictions nor blindly following incorrect ones. The paper emphasizes that well-calibrated trust is key to effective human–AI collaboration

**You:**

According to the experiments in the paper what happens to a person's trust in a model when they are first told its (high) stated accuracy and then get to see its actual (lower) performance?
*
1 point
People's trust is only determined by the initial stated accuracy and does not change.
People's trust is not affected by the stated accuracy at all, only by the performance they observe.
The stated accuracy initially affects trust, but this effect is diluted or reduced after they observe the model's actual performance.
People tend to trust the model more after observing that its real performance is lower than stated.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

✅ The stated accuracy initially affects trust, but this effect is diluted or reduced after they observe the model's actual performance.

The paper found that people do trust high-stated-accuracy models more at first, but once they observe the model’s actual (lower) accuracy, their trust adjusts downward — the influence of the stated accuracy becomes smaller
