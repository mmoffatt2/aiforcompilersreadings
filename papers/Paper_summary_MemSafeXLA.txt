Here’s a structured summary of the paper “Memory Safe Computations with XLA Compiler”

2206.14148v1

Problem and Motivation

Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are optimized for speed, chaining together efficient kernels to maximize runtime performance. However, they often neglect memory efficiency, which is critical on GPUs where exceeding memory capacity causes execution to terminate immediately. This prevents many memory-intensive algorithms (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, transformers) from scaling, even when runtime would be acceptable. Traditional memory-efficient implementations exist but usually require complex, low-level reprogramming that discourages adoption.

Proposed Solution

The authors extend the XLA compiler (used in TensorFlow and JAX) with new optimization passes—called eXLA—that make computations memory-aware while remaining transparent to the user. Their approach modifies the High-Level Optimizer IR (HLO IR) computational graph to keep memory usage within user-specified limits. Key techniques include:

Match-and-Replace Optimizations
Replace naive implementations of operations (e.g., Euclidean distance) with algebraically equivalent but more memory-efficient versions.

Reordering of Operations
Change evaluation order (e.g., matrix chain multiplication) to reduce intermediate tensor sizes and memory footprints.

Data-Flow Graph Splitting
Automatically split large tensor computations into smaller chunks (map-reduce style), executed iteratively with controlled memory usage.

Users can set thresholds (e.g., maximum tensor size) via environment variables, but otherwise no code changes are required.

Experiments and Results

The authors test eXLA on three tasks:

Matrix-Vector Multiplication
Computing kernel matrix-vector products (common in Gaussian processes) usually requires O(n²) memory. With eXLA, the same computations scale to millions of data points without exceeding GPU memory.

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Brute-force kNN normally fails on large datasets due to quadratic memory costs. eXLA allows scaling to very large problems in both TensorFlow and JAX, without code modification. Performance is competitive, though specialized frameworks like KeOps still achieve higher speed.

Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR)
Standard SGPR fails at scale due to memory overflows. With eXLA, the authors run SGPR with up to 10,000 inducing points on a single GPU, surpassing prior state-of-the-art scalable GP implementations. Simply scaling the classic SGPR method with eXLA improved performance over more modern alternatives.

Discussion and Implications

Key Contribution: eXLA enables large-scale, memory-heavy algorithms to run on standard frameworks without code changes.

Practical Impact: Researchers can revive older, theoretically strong methods (e.g., sparse GPs) that were previously abandoned due to scaling difficulties.

Limitations:

XLA’s type system is weak for linear algebra, limiting the range of optimizations.

XLA’s memory allocator is not fully memory-limit-aware, requiring conservative thresholds.

KeOps still outperforms on certain benchmarks because it includes additional optimizations.

Future Potential: Extending compiler-level memory management could make transformers, wide neural nets, and other memory-intensive models feasible on cheaper hardware.

✅ In short: The paper introduces memory-safe XLA compiler extensions (eXLA) that let existing ML code run at scales previously impossible due to GPU memory limits, enabling both practical improvements (e.g., scaling SGPR) and new research opportunities

Do you want me to also fill out a reflection-style writeup (Problem, Hypothesis, Solution, Limitations) in the tone of a student assignment, like you asked in earlier papers?

* * *

**You:**

Did they test on LLMs?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No — the authors did not test their compiler extensions on Large Language Models (LLMs).

The experiments in the paper focus on:

Matrix-vector multiplication for Gaussian processes

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR)

2206.14148v1

They mention in the Discussion that eXLA could be especially useful for transformers, since attention mechanisms are notoriously memory-hungry. They suggest that this approach could help run such models on cheaper hardware or enable distributing them more efficiently. However, this is left as future work — no experiments with LLMs or transformer architectures were actually reported in the paper

2206.14148v1

.

Would you like me to point you to related work that does apply memory-efficient compilation to LLMs/transformers (like FlashAttention, ZeRO, or recent compiler-based approaches)?

* * *

**You:**

Can you go into more details on the key techniques of eXLA

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely — the paper introduces three main classes of compiler optimizations inside XLA (what they call eXLA) to make computations memory-aware without rewriting code

2206.14148v1

. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Match-and-Replace Optimizations

Idea: Detect common memory-inefficient patterns in the HLO (High-Level Optimizer IR) graph and replace them with equivalent but more memory-efficient formulations.

Example – Euclidean Distance:

Naïve: Computing pairwise squared distances between $n$ and $m$ vectors of dimension $d$ produces a temporary $n \times m \times d$ tensor.

Optimized: Rewrite as

$$\|x - y\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 - 2 x \cdot y$$

which only requires an $n \times m$ matrix, eliminating the $d$-dimensional broadcast.

Benefit: Reduces intermediate tensor sizes by orders of magnitude.

Potential: More algebraic linear algebra tricks (e.g., diagonal insertion without forming full matrices) could be added to the compiler.

2. Reordering of Operations

Idea: Change the order of computation in associative operations to reduce intermediate tensor sizes.

Classical Example – Matrix Chain Multiplication:

Default order: $(AB)v$ → computes $AB$ first (an $n \times n$ matrix), then multiplies with $v$.

Complexity: O(n³) time, O(n²) memory.

Better order: $A(Bv)$ → computes $Bv$ first (a vector), then multiplies with $A$.

Complexity: O(n²) time, much lower memory footprint.

How eXLA does it: Detects inefficient matrix-vector chain multiplications in the HLO graph and reorders them automatically.

Benefit: Prevents unnecessary creation of large intermediate matrices.

3. Data-Flow Graph Splitting

Idea: When a tensor is too large to fit in memory, automatically split computations into smaller chunks (similar to MapReduce).

How it works:

Traverse the HLO data-flow graph looking for large “producer” operations followed by size-reducing “consumer” operations (e.g., dot products, reductions).

Identify axes along which the computation can be safely split (e.g., batch dimensions).

Insert a while-loop in the graph that repeatedly computes slices of the tensor and reduces them into the final result.

Parameters available to the user:

Tensor size threshold → maximum allowed tensor size before splitting.

Tensor split size upper bound → maximum chunk size for each split.

Example: Kernel matrix-vector multiplication. Instead of materializing an $n \times n$ kernel matrix (which may require terabytes), eXLA computes manageable sub-blocks iteratively and accumulates the result.

Benefit: Prevents OOM (out-of-memory) errors entirely, with minimal runtime penalty.

Limitations of eXLA

Weak type system in XLA: Linear algebra-specific optimizations are harder since matrices are just arrays without algebraic annotations.

Memory allocator issue: Even after splitting, if multiple large tensors are scheduled at once, XLA can still cause OOM. They had to set conservative memory thresholds smaller than full GPU memory.

Not fully optimized yet: Specialized libraries (like KeOps) still outperform eXLA in certain tasks (e.g., kNN), but eXLA wins in generality and ease of use.

✅ In essence:

Match-and-replace reduces tensor dimensions by algebraic tricks.

Reordering changes computation order to avoid big intermediates.

Splitting chunks large tensor operations into loops so they fit in memory.

Together, these let users run unchanged TensorFlow/JAX code at scales where the standard implementations would crash with OOM

.

Do you want me to also sketch out a visual diagram of how these three techniques transform the computation graph (before vs after) to make it more intuitive?

* * *

**You:**

For match-and-replace, what was the list of common patterns

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good question — the paper actually only implemented one concrete match-and-replace pattern as a proof of concept, though they emphasize that many more linear algebra “tricks” could be added in future

2206.14148v1

.

Here’s the detail:

Implemented Pattern

Naïve Euclidean Distance Computation

Standard form: For $n$ points $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $m$ points $y_m \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the squared distance is

$$\|x_n - y_m\|^2 = \sum_d (x_{nd} - y_{md})^2$$

Naïve implementation: Broadcasting over dimension $d$, producing a temporary tensor of size $n \times m \times d$.

Optimized replacement:

$$\|x_n - y_m\|^2 = \|x_n\|^2 + \|y_m\|^2 - 2 x_n \cdot y_m$$

which only requires an $n \times m$ matrix instead of $n \times m \times d$.

Suggested Extensions (not implemented in this paper)

The authors mention that many other memory-inefficient patterns could be matched and replaced, such as:

Adding diagonals to matrices → without forming a full dense tensor where only the diagonal is nonzero.

Other common linear algebra simplifications (not listed exhaustively in the paper, but they imply patterns like efficient handling of block matrices, structured sparsity, etc. could be added).

So the only explicitly implemented match-and-replace optimization in eXLA (per this paper) is the Euclidean distance rewrite. The framework, however, is general: new algebraic rules could be added to detect and optimize other inefficient tensor expressions

2206.14148v1

.

👉 Do you want me to pull together a list of likely useful match-and-replace candidates for LLMs/transformers (like softmax, attention, diagonal masking), based on the same principles? That would extend what the paper hints at into the LLM space.

* * *

**You:**

Can you explain the data-flow graph splitting? Does this not slow things down if you split computations up and load them in and out of memory

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — this is the most important optimization in the paper, and yes, at first glance splitting up a computation into chunks does sound like it might slow things down. Let’s break it down:

How Data-Flow Graph Splitting Works

The idea is to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) crashes by dividing big tensor operations into smaller pieces that can fit into memory, and then recombining the results.

Identify large tensors

eXLA traverses the High-Level Optimizer (HLO) data-flow graph from the output backward (depth-first).

It looks for producers of huge tensors (e.g., pairwise distance matrices, kernel matrices) that later get consumed by a reducing operation (e.g., dot product, sum, mean).

Find splittable axes

Some operations are trivially parallelizable (e.g., element-wise ops can split along any axis).

Others, like triangular solves, can only split along batching dimensions.

eXLA records which axes can safely be partitioned.

Insert while-loops

Instead of building the entire massive tensor at once, the compiler transforms the computation into a loop over slices of the input.

Each slice (chunk) is processed independently, and the partial results are combined (reduced) into the final output.

This is very similar to a MapReduce strategy, except it’s applied for memory savings rather than distributed computing.

User control

Two flags let the user tune splitting:

Tensor size threshold → when to split.

Tensor split size → max chunk size.

Does This Slow Computations Down?

In theory: Yes, because you add overhead (looping, slicing, combining results). Splitting prevents fusion of operations and may require more reads/writes.

In practice (per experiments): The slowdown is surprisingly small.

Example: kernel matrix-vector multiplication of size $10^6$.

Naïve (no splitting): would need 8 TB memory → impossible on a 32 GB GPU.

With eXLA splitting: runs successfully, memory never exceeds the user-defined threshold (say 1 GB), and runtime scales well (Figure 2 in the paper).

For kNN: eXLA allowed brute-force pairwise distance calculations that would otherwise OOM. Performance was comparable to, or even better than, vanilla JAX/TF — though still slower than specialized libraries like KeOps.

For Sparse Gaussian Processes: The split version not only avoided OOM but actually scaled to 10× more inducing points, outperforming some state-of-the-art scalable GP implementations.

So the trade-off is:

Without splitting → code is fast but crashes due to OOM.

With splitting → code runs (slightly slower) but actually finishes, and scaling to larger problems often outweighs the overhead.

Why the Slowdown Isn’t Huge

Splitting frees memory as soon as each chunk finishes, so the GPU doesn’t sit idle waiting.

Many ML ops are dominated by FLOPs, not memory bandwidth — so as long as chunks are large enough, GPU utilization remains high.

You avoid allocating massive intermediates, which themselves could cause thrashing or allocator overhead.

✅ Bottom line:
Data-flow graph splitting trades a small runtime overhead for guaranteed memory safety and the ability to scale. In practice, it enables running problems orders of magnitude larger than before, so even if each iteration is a bit slower, the overall capability is far better

2206.14148v1

.

Would you like me to sketch a before vs. after diagram (big tensor → split into looped chunks) to visually show how eXLA transforms the graph?

* * *

**You:**

so this isn't really a memory optimization, but more of just preventing running out of memory

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly — you’ve hit the core distinction.

What eXLA’s data-flow graph splitting does is not so much a true memory optimization (like reducing the total number of bytes that must ever be processed) but rather a scheduling strategy that prevents OOM by restructuring the computation.

✅ Why it’s not a pure memory optimization

The same amount of work still has to be done.

The same number of floating point operations (FLOPs) are performed.

The total volume of data read/written is roughly the same — sometimes even a bit more due to slicing and recombining.

So in terms of algorithmic complexity, it hasn’t reduced memory requirements per se.

✅ What it does optimize

It caps the peak memory footprint at a user-defined threshold (e.g., never allocate more than 1 GB at a time).

Instead of materializing one giant intermediate tensor (which may be infeasible), it ensures only manageable slices are ever resident in memory.

This lets the program finish instead of crashing with OOM.

So you could think of it as memory safety via controlled chunking, not as true compression or efficiency in the sense of fitting the same workload into less memory.

⚖️ Trade-off

Without splitting → program may run faster if it fits in memory (because big ops can be fused and parallelized).

With splitting → program incurs some overhead (looping, slicing, recombination) but crucially does not crash, which often enables scaling to problem sizes orders of magnitude larger.

✅ In short: eXLA is more about making memory constraints survivable than squeezing out absolute efficiency.

That said, the paper does also include match-and-replace and reordering passes — those are genuine memory optimizations (since they reduce the size of intermediates without changing the structure of execution). Splitting is more like a safety net on top of that.

Would you like me to contrast eXLA’s splitting vs. true memory optimization approaches (like FlashAttention, gradient checkpointing, or tensor rematerialization in PyTorch)? That might help clarify where this sits in the landscape.

* * *

**You:**

For the reordering of operations, it seems like it is faster compute and memory. So, why doesn't XLA do this in the first place

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

That’s a sharp observation — you’re right: reordering matrix multiplications (like turning $(AB)v$ into $A(Bv)$) is both faster and uses less memory. So why isn’t XLA already doing this by default?

The paper explains and implies a few reasons

2206.14148v1

:

1. Scope of XLA’s Existing Optimizations

XLA already does “classic” compiler optimizations:

Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)

Dead Code Elimination (DCE)

Operation fusion for speed

These focus on runtime efficiency and eliminating redundant computation.

But XLA historically hasn’t included linear algebra–aware transformations like matrix chain reordering. That’s a more specialized optimization than generic compiler passes.

2. Associativity vs. Generality

Matrix multiplication is associative: $(AB)v = A(Bv)$.

But many linear algebra operations are not freely reorderable. For example:

Non-associative ops (floating-point differences, due to rounding).

Chained operations where the best order depends on the exact shapes of inputs (matrix multiplication cost differs if matrices are “tall-skinny” vs. “square”).

So while in principle reordering can help, a compiler has to be careful not to break correctness (or slow things down in weird edge cases). XLA took the conservative route of not touching algebraic operation order unless explicitly told to.

3. Focus on Speed, Not Memory

The original XLA design was driven by throughput and fusion for GPUs/TPUs.

Large tensor intermediates weren’t a priority — if you OOM, the assumption was “get more hardware” or “shard across devices.”

The authors of this paper argue that this left memory-efficiency gaps that a compiler should solve.

4. Cost of Choosing the Right Order

The Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem (optimally choosing the order of multiplications) is a well-known algorithmic problem.

Solving it exactly is O(n³) in the number of matrices, though efficient heuristics exist.

Adding such heuristics into XLA’s compilation pipeline might increase compile time, which XLA developers traditionally try to minimize.

(This is similar to why PyTorch 2.0’s compilers sometimes don’t fuse as aggressively as possible — trading off compile time vs runtime speed).

✅ So why eXLA adds it

The eXLA authors specifically target linear algebra bottlenecks (kernels, kNN, Gaussian Processes), where memory is the limiting factor. For these workloads, reordering is both safe and gives dramatic gains.

They implemented a simplified reordering rule for matrix-vector chains (not the full matrix chain problem).

This covers the most common bad case: $(AB)v$ being evaluated left-to-right instead of right-to-left.

🔑 In short:
XLA never implemented reordering because it prioritized speed-focused, general-purpose compiler passes and didn’t incorporate domain-specific linear algebra heuristics. eXLA fills that gap by adding simple but highly effective rules for memory-sensitive ops.

Would you like me to explain how other compilers handle this (like TVM or KeOps) and whether they already include this kind of reordering? That would give some context for how unique eXLA’s approach is.
