Read this paper. Can you explain the difference between define-and-run and define-by-run

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In the Relay paper, the authors explain the difference between define-and-run and define-by-run frameworks as two approaches to building and executing deep learning models

1904.08368v2

:

Define-and-Run

What It Means:
Define-and-run frameworks (like TensorFlow, Caffe, and Theano) first define a static computation graph that describes the entire model. Once the graph is defined, it is "run" or executed.

Key Characteristics:

Static graph: The whole computation graph is known before any execution starts.

Optimizations: The static graph allows powerful whole-program optimizations such as operator fusion and memory planning.

Deployment: Because there is no dependency on the host language (like Python) at runtime, these frameworks are easier to deploy on production systems.

Limitations: They are often less flexible — e.g., you cannot easily change control flow based on data at runtime or have models whose structure depends on input data. Workarounds like TensorFlow Fold exist, but they add complexity.

Define-by-Run

What It Means:
Define-by-run frameworks (like PyTorch, Chainer, Gluon, and TensorFlow eager mode) build the computation graph on the fly as operations are executed.

Key Characteristics:

Dynamic graph: A new computation graph is constructed for each execution trace.

Flexibility: You can use native host language features (like Python’s control flow, loops, and conditionals), making model definition very intuitive and expressive.

Tradeoff: Because a new graph is created per run, the framework must re-optimize the graph each time, which adds overhead. Communication between the host language and accelerator can also be more expensive.

Summary Table
Aspect	Define-and-Run	Define-by-Run
Graph Construction	Predefined, static	Built dynamically at runtime
Optimization	Whole-graph, aggressive	Per-trace, less global optimization
Flexibility	Limited control flow, harder to define dynamic models	Full use of host language features
Deployment	Easier (no Python dependency at runtime)	Harder (needs Python or trace export)
Overhead	Lower runtime overhead	Some runtime overhead for graph building

Would you like me to also explain how Relay attempts to combine the best of both approaches (static whole-program representation + support for control flow and higher-order functions)? That’s a big part of this paper’s contribution.

* * *

**You:**

Yes. Does this mean Relay is define-and-run or define-by-run?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — Relay is actually neither purely define-and-run nor define-by-run, but rather a hybrid approach that takes the best parts of both

1904.08368v2

.

Relay’s Approach

Relay represents the entire program as a static IR, like a define-and-run system, but supports control flow, first-class functions, recursion, and data structures — features that you normally only get in a define-by-run system.

This means:

Static whole-program representation:
Relay builds a full intermediate representation (IR) of the program ahead of time, which allows whole-program optimizations (like fusion, partial evaluation, and quantization) just like define-and-run frameworks.

Dynamic expressivity:
Unlike classical define-and-run frameworks, Relay can express dynamic models where the structure depends on input data. It does this by supporting:

if/else control flow

pattern matching

recursive functions

algebraic data types (e.g., trees, lists)

This is closer to the expressivity of define-by-run frameworks, but without the runtime graph-building overhead.

Why This Matters

Relay's design allows researchers to:

Write models with complex control flow (like TreeLSTMs, variable-length sequences, etc.).

Still get ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and cross-operator optimization, which define-by-run systems struggle to do efficiently.

Target a wide variety of hardware backends because of its static nature.

So, you can think of Relay as:

"Define-once, optimize fully, but keep the dynamic expressivity of define-by-run."

In Short

Relay is closer to define-and-run in its compilation pipeline (because it compiles a whole program IR), but inherits the flexibility of define-by-run frameworks by supporting general-purpose programming constructs.

Would you like me to sketch a quick diagram comparing define-and-run, define-by-run, and Relay to make this distinction really clear? It might help visualize how Relay sits between the two.

* * *

**You:**

Why does define-and-run not work well with control flow

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good follow-up — this is exactly why define-by-run became popular.

Define-and-run (static graph) frameworks struggle with control flow because the entire computation graph must be fixed before execution, and control flow is inherently data-dependent — it may change from one input to the next.

Here’s why this is a problem, as explained in the Relay paper

1904.08368v2

:

1. Static Graphs Need a Fixed Topology

In a define-and-run system like TensorFlow (pre-eager), you first build the entire graph, then "run" it.

If you want an if statement or a while loop, the framework can’t just use Python’s native if/while — it needs a special graph construct (like tf.cond or tf.while_loop).

These constructs encode control flow as special nodes and control edges inside the graph, which are hard to reason about and optimize because they are not standard graph operations.

2. Input-Dependent Control Flow Breaks Static Graph Assumptions

If the model’s structure depends on data (e.g., a TreeLSTM where the number of children varies per input), you would need to rebuild the entire graph every time you get new input shapes or branching patterns.

Rebuilding and re-optimizing graphs for each input is expensive and defeats the purpose of having a static graph in the first place.

3. Makes Compiler Optimizations Harder

Because control flow is encoded using special nodes (instead of normal function calls or recursion), traditional compiler optimizations (like inlining, loop unrolling, partial evaluation) are much harder to apply.

There’s no clear notion of lexical scope or first-class functions, which limits higher-order transformations.

4. Developer Experience

Users often have to write awkward, "graph-friendly" code rather than using normal programming language constructs.

Debugging is harder, because you are manipulating an abstract graph rather than running step-by-step code.

In Summary

Define-and-run systems work best for fixed, feed-forward computation graphs (like standard CNNs).
They break down when:

The model topology changes depending on input.

Complex, data-dependent control flow is needed.

Dynamic sequence lengths or recursion are involved.

This is why researchers moved toward define-by-run frameworks (PyTorch, Chainer): they let you use normal Python control flow, so models with loops, conditionals, or dynamic structures are much easier to express and debug.

Would you like me to give you a concrete example (e.g., how tf.while_loop looks in define-and-run vs. a simple while loop in PyTorch) to illustrate this difference? It can make the pain points very clear.

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — let’s walk through a concrete example.

Suppose you want to implement a simple loop that keeps doubling a value until it exceeds 100.

Define-and-Run Example (TensorFlow static graph)
python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable
x = tf.constant(2)

# Define the condition function (must use TF ops, no Python if)
def cond(x):
    return tf.less(x, 100)

# Define the body function (must use TF ops)
def body(x):
    return tf.multiply(x, 2)

# Build a while loop in the computation graph
result = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [x])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    output = sess.run(result)
    print(output)


Key observations:

You cannot use a regular while loop — you must build the loop as special nodes in the graph using tf.while_loop.

Both the condition and body must be written in terms of TensorFlow ops (tf.less, tf.multiply).

You have to run the graph in a session to get the result.

Harder to debug — you can’t just print intermediate values in the loop without adding special tf.print nodes.

Define-by-Run Example (PyTorch)
python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2)

# Just use normal Python control flow
while x < 100:
    x = x * 2

print(x)


Key observations:

No special graph-building functions are needed — you just write a normal while loop.

You can print or debug inside the loop like normal Python.

The computation graph is built dynamically as the loop executes.

Why This Matters

In the TensorFlow (define-and-run) version:

Graph topology must be built before execution — so control flow must be expressed using graph primitives (tf.while_loop, tf.cond, etc.).

This can be cumbersome for complex or nested control flow, or when the loop structure depends on input data.

Debugging and experimenting is harder because you can’t run partial graphs easily.

In the PyTorch (define-by-run) version:

The graph is built as you go, so data-dependent control flow "just works."

This is why researchers love define-by-run for experimenting with new architectures like TreeLSTMs, dynamic unrolling, or conditional computation.

Would you like me to also show you how Relay would represent this loop (to demonstrate how it keeps a static program but still supports recursion/control flow)? That might help illustrate why Relay is considered a "best of both worlds" approach.

* * *

**You:**

Let By construction, computation graphs enjoy implicit sharing of subcomputations via multiple outgoing dependency
edges. Implicit sharing is often implemented via pointers that
uniquely identify subgraphs, a property useful for both execution and analysis. Previous frameworks often obtain this
sharing by using a host language’s name binding to construct
a graph (e.g., by binding a Python variable to a subgraph and
using that variable to construct other subgraphs). Generalpurpose programming languages, on the other hand, provide
explicit sharing via binding constructs, such as let. In programs free of scope, ordering, and effects, implicit sharing
and explicit sharing are semantically equivalent. However, in
practice, user programs rely on effects and ordering, requiring
previous approaches to provide workarounds. For example,
TensorFlow’s Eager Mode inserts dummy control edges in
its generated graphs to impose effect ordering. The lack of
lexical scope in computation graphs complicates language
features, like first-class functions and control flow, and reduces the precision of traditional analyses, such as liveness,
because the high-level program structure is absent [32, 39].
The addition of a humble let binding, a central concept in
functional languages, provides explicit sharing and a solution
to the problems outlined above

Can you explain this paragraph

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely — this paragraph is unpacking a subtle but important point about why Relay’s functional design (with let bindings) is better than the way earlier frameworks handle graph construction. Let’s break it down step by step.

1. Implicit vs. Explicit Sharing

Implicit sharing in computation graphs:
When you build a computation graph (like in TensorFlow or Theano), the framework automatically “shares” subcomputations if multiple nodes depend on them.

Example: If you compute z = x + y once and then use z in two different places, the framework stores a single x+y subgraph and points to it from both places.

This is often implemented using pointers or references to the same node — hence “implicit” sharing.

Explicit sharing in programming languages:
In normal programming languages, we make this sharing explicit by naming a value and reusing it:

python
z = x + y
a = z * 2
b = z * 3


Here, z is a binding — it explicitly names the subcomputation so we can reuse it.

2. Why Implicit Sharing Alone Is Not Enough

Implicit sharing works fine when programs are simple and free of effects (like mutation) or ordering requirements.
But in real programs:

We may rely on side effects (e.g., updating state, printing values).

We may rely on specific execution order (e.g., doing operation A before B).

Computation graphs by themselves don’t have a clear notion of scope or order, so frameworks had to hack around this:

TensorFlow Eager Mode, for instance, had to add dummy control edges just to enforce that certain operations happen in sequence, even if the dataflow doesn’t require it.

3. Why Lack of Lexical Scope Hurts

No lexical scope:
In a raw computation graph, there isn’t a notion of local variables, blocks, or function scope — it’s just a global DAG of nodes.

This makes advanced language features (like first-class functions or recursion) very hard to implement.

It also makes program analyses less precise — for example, liveness analysis (figuring out when a value can be freed) is harder without knowing the scope in which a value was created and last used.

4. Relay’s Solution: let Bindings

Relay adds explicit let bindings (like in functional languages such as OCaml or Haskell):

relay
let %z = add(%x, %y);
let %a = multiply(%z, 2);
let %b = multiply(%z, 3);


This makes sharing explicit — %z is clearly a reusable value.

It introduces lexical scope, which:

Makes the order of computation and dependencies explicit.

Enables optimizations (constant folding, dead code elimination, etc.).

Makes analyses like liveness precise (because %z’s lifetime is clearly delimited).

Bottom Line

This paragraph is saying:

“Computation graphs used to rely on implicit sharing (pointer-based reuse), but without lexical scope and ordering, they had to use hacks to enforce effects and sequencing. By adding let bindings, Relay makes sharing explicit, introduces proper scoping, and solves these problems — enabling cleaner semantics, better optimization, and support for advanced language features.”

Would you like me to draw a side-by-side example showing a simple computation graph with implicit sharing vs. the same thing expressed with explicit let bindings? That could make this idea very concrete.

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great — here’s a side-by-side example to make this really concrete.

Example Problem

Suppose we want to compute:

$$a = (x + y) * 2 \quad \text{and} \quad b = (x + y) * 3$$

Notice that (x + y) is reused.

Implicit Sharing in a Computation Graph

In a classical define-and-run framework (like TensorFlow’s static graph mode), this might look like this under the hood:

scss
   x ──┐
       ├─ (+) ── z ── (*)×2 ── a
   y ──┘           └─ (*)×3 ── b


The subgraph for x + y is created once, and two edges point to it.

The sharing is implicit — you never explicitly name z.

If you need to enforce an order (e.g., if (x+y) had side effects), you might need to manually add control dependencies to make sure it runs first before its consumers.

Explicit Sharing with let Binding in Relay

Relay would represent this with an explicit binding:

relay
let %z = add(%x, %y);    -- compute once, name it
let %a = multiply(%z, 2);
let %b = multiply(%z, 3);
(%a, %b)


Diagrammatically:

perl
%z = x + y      <-- explicit "let" binding introduces scope
%a = %z * 2
%b = %z * 3


Now %z is a named value with a clear lexical scope.

The compiler knows exactly:

when %z is created,

when it is last used,

and can optimize memory (free %z after %b is computed).

No need for dummy control edges — order is enforced by the let bindings.

Why This Matters

Optimization becomes easier:
Compiler can safely do constant folding, CSE (common subexpression elimination), or dead code elimination because it knows what is shared.

Better semantics:
If you add side effects later (e.g., logging, state updates), the order of operations is unambiguous.

Supports first-class functions & recursion:
Because there’s proper scope and binding, you can abstract over computations just like in a functional language.

Would you like me to also show how lack of explicit scope makes liveness analysis harder (e.g., freeing intermediate tensors too early or too late)? That’s one of the key reasons the Relay paper emphasizes this point.

* * *

**You:**

what does a lowering strategy mean?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — lowering strategy is a compiler term, and it shows up a lot in papers like Relay’s because deep learning frameworks use multi-level IRs.

Here’s what it means in this context:

Definition

Lowering is the process of taking a high-level representation of a program (or operator) and translating it into a lower-level representation that is closer to the target hardware.

A lowering strategy is simply the specific approach or set of rules the compiler uses to perform that translation.

Example in Deep Learning

Think about an operator like conv2d (2D convolution):

At the high level, we just say:

relay
y = conv2d(x, w, stride=1, padding=1)


This is a semantic description: "do a convolution."

The lowering strategy decides how to implement this convolution for a particular backend:

On a CPU: maybe use an im2col + GEMM algorithm.

On a GPU: maybe call CuDNN’s convolution kernel.

On a custom accelerator: maybe generate specialized loops using TVM’s scheduling primitives.

Why It’s Important

Performance portability:
The same high-level operator can be lowered differently depending on hardware. This allows Relay to be hardware-agnostic at the IR level but still get good performance.

Extensibility:
You can add new lowering strategies for new backends (e.g., RISC-V accelerator, FPGA) without changing the high-level Relay program.

Optimization opportunities:
Before lowering, you can perform graph-level optimizations (fusion, quantization). After lowering, you can apply schedule-level optimizations (tiling, vectorization, memory layout tuning).

Analogy

Think of lowering like translating a recipe:

The recipe (high-level IR) says “make a cake.”

The lowering strategy decides how to make it:

Oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (home kitchen).

Use a convection oven at a bakery with a special tray (industrial kitchen).

Adjust for high altitude baking (different "backend").

The end result is the same cake, but the steps are optimized for the environment.

In Relay

Relay operators are opaque at the high level, and each backend can choose its own lowering strategy.
This is what lets Relay target CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs — each with different optimal code.

Would you like me to show you a concrete example of lowering from Relay to TVM (e.g., how a conv2d is represented first as a Relay op, then as a TVM compute expression)? That would make this even clearer.

**You:**

Let us consider a hypothetical scenario that exemplifies IR
design tensions in DL compilers. Suppose a machine learning
engineer wants to write an Android app that uses sentiment
analysis to determine the moods of its users. To maintain
privacy, the app must run completely on-device, i.e., no work
can be offloaded to the cloud. The engineer decides to use a
variant of TreeLSTM, a deep learning model that uses a tree
structure [46]. Unfortunately, current frameworks’ IRs cannot
directly encode trees, so she must use a framework extension
like TensorFlow Fold [26].
Suppose that after adapting the model to run on her phone,
the out-of-the-box performance of her model on her particular
platform is not satisfactory, requiring her to optimize it. She
chooses to employ quantization, an optimization that potentially trades accuracy for performance by replacing floatingpoint datatypes with low-precision ones. Although researchers
have developed a variety of quantization strategies, each of
which makes use of different bit-widths, rounding modes, and
datatypes, our engineer must use a strategy supported by existing frameworks [15, 14, 34]. Unfortunately, frameworks
only provide support for a small number of strategies, and supporting new quantization strategies is non-trivial. Each combination of operator, datatype, bit-width, and platform requires
unique operator implementations. Optimizations like operator fusion exacerbate this combinatorial explosion, further
increasing the number of unique implementations required.
Furthermore, if a framework doesn’t have specific support for
the target phone model she cannot take advantage of specialized deep learning instructions or coprocessors [3].
The scenario above highlights the three-pronged extensibility challenge for DL IRs:
1. Expressivity: It should be straightforward to write models involving control flow, first-class functions and data
structures (e.g., trees, graphs, and lists).
2. Composability: It should be straightforward to add and
compose new optimizations with existing ones (e.g., quantization, operator fusion, and partial evaluation).
3. Portability: It should be straightforward to add new hardware targets (e.g., TPU, Inferentia)

Can you understand this scenario and explain it in more detail. How would I describe in in a slide deck to give an example of the issues at the time of the this paper with exisiting DL compilers

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — this is one of the most helpful parts of the paper because it paints a very concrete picture of why Relay was needed. Here’s how I’d unpack it and turn it into a compelling slide deck example.

Breaking Down the Scenario

This hypothetical engineer’s situation exposes three distinct pain points with existing DL compilers and frameworks at the time:

1. Expressivity Problem (Model Representation)

The engineer’s task: Build a TreeLSTM-based sentiment analysis model that must run on-device.

Challenge:

Existing frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow static graphs) could not natively represent trees or dynamic computation graphs.

Needed special extensions like TensorFlow Fold, which dynamically stitched together subgraphs at runtime.

This meant using an awkward, less general solution, instead of just writing a natural model with recursion or data structures.

2. Composability Problem (Optimizations)

The engineer’s task: Speed up the model (for battery life and latency) using quantization.

Challenge:

Frameworks only supported a few fixed quantization strategies (e.g., int8 with a specific rounding mode).

To add a new strategy (different bit-width, datatype, rounding scheme), you would have to implement:

A new operator kernel for every operator + datatype combination.

Adjust for every hardware backend.

Operator fusion made this worse — fusing quantized ops meant writing new fused kernels manually.

Result: A combinatorial explosion of operator implementations, which made experimentation slow and brittle.

3. Portability Problem (Hardware Support)

The engineer’s task: Make sure the model runs fast on her specific phone.

Challenge:

If the framework did not support the device’s special neural accelerators or instructions, she was stuck with a slow CPU/GPU fallback.

There was no easy way to retarget the model to new hardware without major engineering work.

How to Present This in a Slide Deck

Here’s a good slide-by-slide narrative that would tell this story clearly:

Slide 1: "A Real-World Challenge"

Title: "Why Existing DL Compilers Struggled"

Visual:

Cartoon of an engineer building a phone app (small icon of phone, ML model, user privacy lock).

Bullets:

Privacy requirement → must run on-device.

Needs a TreeLSTM model → cannot easily represent trees in TensorFlow graph.

Must optimize for performance → needs quantization, but framework only supports a fixed set of schemes.

Wants to use device’s accelerator → no built-in support from framework.

Slide 2: "Where It Breaks Down"

Title: "Three Pain Points in Existing IRs"

Three Columns or Callouts:

Expressivity	Composability	Portability

Would you like me to create a slide-ready visual for the "Three Pain Points" slide (maybe a simple figure with three columns, icons, and example text) so you can drop it straight into your deck?

* * *

**You:**

Can you do a pros and cons of define-by-run vs define-and-run

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely — a pros & cons comparison is a great way to summarize these two paradigms. Here’s a clear and presentation-friendly version:

Define-and-Run vs. Define-by-Run
Aspect	Define-and-Run (Static Graph)	Define-by-Run (Dynamic Graph)
How It Works	Build the entire computation graph first, then execute it.	Build the computation graph as the program runs (on-the-fly).
Pros	✅ Whole-graph optimization – can do memory planning, operator fusion, global constant folding.
✅ Great for deployment – graph is independent of Python, portable to production runtimes.
✅ Predictable performance – static graph allows aggressive ahead-of-time compilation.	✅ Highly flexible – can use normal control flow (if, while, recursion).
✅ Easier to prototype – feels like normal Python, good for research and debugging.
✅ Dynamic shapes/models supported naturally (no need for special ops like tf.while_loop).
Cons	❌ Rigid – hard to express dynamic control flow or models with data-dependent structure (TreeLSTMs, variable sequence lengths).
❌ Requires special graph constructs (tf.cond, tf.while_loop).
❌ Debugging is hard (no step-by-step execution).	❌ Less global optimization – graph must be re-traced & re-optimized for each unique execution path.
❌ Higher overhead – CPU/host must coordinate with accelerator frequently.
❌ Harder to export/deploy (tied to Python execution unless you capture and freeze the graph).
Summary Takeaways

Define-and-Run = great for deployment & performance, but less expressive and harder to work with for research.

Define-by-Run = great for research & rapid prototyping, but harder to optimize & deploy efficiently.

Slide Suggestion

For a slide deck, I’d show this as a side-by-side comparison table (like above), or even two columns with green checkmarks ✅ and red crosses ❌ under each approach.

You can also add visual metaphors:

Static graph: A blueprint of a house — designed once, then built.

Dynamic graph: A chef cooking — decides next step as ingredients arrive.

Would you like me to add a third column for Relay to show how it combines the best of both worlds (and address these cons)? That can be a powerful way to motivate Relay’s existence.

Let By construction, computation graphs enjoy implicit sharing of subcomputations via multiple outgoing dependency
edges. Implicit sharing is often implemented via pointers that
uniquely identify subgraphs, a property useful for both execution and analysis. Previous frameworks often obtain this
sharing by using a host language’s name binding to construct
a graph (e.g., by binding a Python variable to a subgraph and
using that variable to construct other subgraphs). Generalpurpose programming languages, on the other hand, provide
explicit sharing via binding constructs, such as let. In programs free of scope, ordering, and effects, implicit sharing
and explicit sharing are semantically equivalent. However, in
practice, user programs rely on effects and ordering, requiring
previous approaches to provide workarounds. For example,
TensorFlow’s Eager Mode inserts dummy control edges in
its generated graphs to impose effect ordering. The lack of
lexical scope in computation graphs complicates language
features, like first-class functions and control flow, and reduces the precision of traditional analyses, such as liveness,
because the high-level program structure is absent [32, 39].
The addition of a humble let binding, a central concept in
functional languages, provides explicit sharing and a solution
to the problems outlined above.
Control Flow Emerging models, particularly in the domain
of natural language processing, increasingly rely on datadependent control flow, forcing frameworks based on computation graph IRs to incorporate control flow, often through
ad hoc and difficult-to-extend constructs. For example, TensorFlow Fold [27] extends TF with special combinators that
dynamically compute a graph for each shape permutation;
these high-level constructs are opaque to further optimizations.
The functional programming community has demonstrated
that recursion and pattern matching are sufficient to implement arbitrary combinators for control flow and iteration (e.g.,
maps, folds, and scans). To support the definition of functional combinators we enrich Relay with two more language
features to implement arbitrary combinators: if and first-class

Can you explain these sections

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — these two sections are dense but very important, because they explain why Relay introduces functional features like let, if, and first-class functions. Let’s break them down carefully.

1. The "Let" Binding Section
Key Idea

This section explains implicit vs explicit sharing and why adding let to Relay is a big deal.

Implicit Sharing in Computation Graphs

Computation graphs (like TensorFlow’s static graph) automatically share repeated subcomputations.

Example:

python
z = x + y
a = z * 2
b = z * 3


In a graph framework, z = x + y is created once, and the framework creates two edges pointing to it.
You never explicitly say “reuse z” — the sharing is implicit.

This is done using pointers or references inside the graph — the same node is referenced by multiple dependents.

Explicit Sharing in Programming Languages

In normal programming languages, sharing is made explicit by naming it:

python
let z = x + y in
let a = z * 2 in
let b = z * 3 in ...


This makes scope and order clear.

Why Implicit Sharing Causes Problems

When programs rely on effects (e.g. side-effects like updating state) or order of execution, implicit sharing can be ambiguous.

Frameworks like TensorFlow Eager had to add dummy control edges just to enforce ordering (so that side-effects happen in the right sequence).

Lack of lexical scope (no clear block where a value lives) makes:

First-class functions harder to implement (functions don’t have clear closures or variable environments).

Control flow harder to reason about (no clean block structure).

Analyses like liveness (deciding when to free memory) less precise — because you don’t know when something stops being used.

Solution: Add let Bindings

Relay uses explicit let bindings, which:

Clearly define a name, scope, and lifetime for each value.

Make order and dependencies explicit.

Make it easier to implement functional features like first-class functions, recursion, and higher-order combinators.

Enable precise optimizations — compiler knows exactly when something can be eliminated, inlined, or freed.

2. Control Flow Section
Key Idea

Relay’s design supports general, data-dependent control flow in a principled way, unlike older frameworks that relied on ad hoc constructs.

The Problem

Modern models (especially in NLP) often need data-dependent control flow:

Example: TreeLSTM, recursive models, dynamic sequence lengths, conditional computation.

Computation graphs were originally designed for fixed feed-forward networks (CNNs).

Existing solutions were ad hoc:

TensorFlow Fold created special combinators that dynamically stitched graphs together for each input’s shape.

These combinators were opaque to optimizations — once built, the compiler couldn’t see inside them to optimize.

Functional Programming Inspiration

In functional languages, we know that recursion + pattern matching are enough to build any control flow combinator:

map, fold, scan, while, etc. can all be expressed this way.

Relay therefore enriches its language with:

if expressions: For conditional branching.

First-class functions: Functions are values — they can be passed around, stored, and applied dynamically.

With these primitives, users can write any control flow pattern they want — and the compiler can still see the whole program and optimize it.

* * *

**You:**

Can you explain how relay improves control flow and first class functions

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — this is one of Relay’s biggest contributions, so it’s worth breaking down clearly. Relay takes ideas from functional programming to make control flow and first-class functions first-class citizens in the IR — something that earlier DL compilers struggled with.

1. Problem with Control Flow in Previous Frameworks

Earlier computation-graph-based frameworks (define-and-run) had very limited or awkward control flow:

TensorFlow static graph: Required special ops like tf.cond and tf.while_loop. These are clunky, hard to debug, and not easily optimized.

TensorFlow Fold / DyNet: Created graphs dynamically per input — flexible, but the resulting graphs were opaque, preventing whole-program optimizations.

PyTorch (define-by-run): Allowed natural Python control flow, but because graphs were constructed on-the-fly, you lost the ability to do global ahead-of-time (AOT) optimization across all possible execution paths.

2. Relay’s Approach: Functional Control Flow

Relay improves on this by providing true language-level constructs for control flow:

✅ if Expressions

Relay supports if as a first-class expression — it can appear anywhere in the program, and its result can be passed around like any other value.

Because the entire program is still represented as a single, analyzable IR, the compiler can:

See both branches of the if.

Optimize dead branches if conditions are constant.

Perform liveness analysis and memory planning across control flow boundaries.

Example in Relay IR:

relay
let %z = add(%x, %y);
if (%z > 0) {
    multiply(%z, 2)
} else {
    subtract(%z, 3)
}

✅ Recursion & Pattern Matching

Relay supports recursive function definitions and pattern matching, which together allow users to express arbitrary control-flow combinators:

You can write map, fold, scan, while, and even dynamic graph construction directly in Relay.

Pattern matching allows you to deconstruct algebraic data types (like lists or trees) — perfect for models like TreeLSTMs.

3. First-Class Functions

Relay treats functions as first-class values:

You can define functions, pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, store them in data structures.

This enables higher-order functions — functions that take other functions as arguments (e.g., map(f, list)).

This is impossible or very awkward in traditional computation graphs, which don’t have lexical scope or closures.

4. Why This Matters

By combining control flow + first-class functions + static typing:

Relay lets you write arbitrarily dynamic models without leaving the IR.

The compiler can still do whole-program optimizations:

Dead-code elimination across branches.

Operator fusion across loops or conditionals.

Memory planning even when shapes are data-dependent.

In short: you get the flexibility of PyTorch with the optimizability of TensorFlow XLA.

Slide Deck Summary

Title: "Expressive and Optimizable Programs"

Bullets:

Functions are first-class – enable higher-order programming (map, fold, etc.).

Compiler still sees entire program → can optimize globally.

3.2. Type System
Relay’s type system is essential to optimizations. Typing
guarantees both well-formedness of the program and provides
crucial tensor shape information to perform allocation, check
correctness, and facilitate loop optimizations. Shape information is also valuable for data layout transformations and
tensorization, two transformations often demanded by hardware accelerators. In computation graph IRs, only numeric
data types and shapes are tracked for each operator. Symbolic
shapes (i.e., shape polymorphism) are only handled dynamically, inhibiting certain types of optimizations.
It is possible to model arbitrarily complex static properties,
such as shape information, with a dependent type theory [40],
but such a design incurs significant user complexity. By incorporating shape analysis into a broader type system, Relay’s
type system balances the desire for static tensor shapes with
usability. In this subsection, we describe how to extend a
polymorphic type system with shape information and type
inference with shape inference.
Tensor Types The primitive value in Relay is a tensor, which
has a shape and a base type (tensor type in Figure 1). Base
types describe the elements of tensors by tracking the bit width,
the number of lanes (for utilizing vectorized intrinsics), and
whether the type is floating point or integral. To ensure Relay
can offload tensor computation to devices with greatly varying architectures, Relay tensors may only contain base types,
preventing, for example, tensors of closures. The shape of
a tensor is a tuple of integers describing the tensor’s dimensions. A dimension may be a variable or arithmetic expression
that indicates how the output shape of an operator depends
on those of its inputs. Functions may be polymorphic over
shapes, which results in shape constraints that must be solved
during type inference. Sec. 3.2 describes the process. Relay
also supports a special shape called Any, which is used to mark
a dynamic shape when static relationships are not profitable to
model.
Operators and Type Relations Operators are one of the key
primitives that differs from those of general-purpose programming languages. Relay’s use of opaque operators enables
backends to choose different lowering strategies based on the
hardware target. Relay’s operator set is extensible, meaning that users may add new operations. Supporting common
or user-defined tensor operators requires a type system that
can adapt to complex shape relationships between input and
output types (e.g., elementwise operators with broadcasting semantics).
To handle the constraints between operators’ argument
shapes, Relay’s type system introduces type relations. A type
relation is implemented as a function in the meta-language
and represents a symbolic relationship between the input and
output types. When developers add a new operator to Relay,
they may constrain its type with an existing relation or add
their own. Function types may include one or more type relations over a subset of the argument types and the return type.
The type checker enforces that these relationships hold at each
call site.
Type Inference To incorporate type relations into Relay’s
type system, we enrich a Hindley-Milner-style type inference
algorithm with a constraint solver. Relay’s inference algorithm
has three steps: first, it performs a pass over the AST, generating types and a set of relations, then it solves the incurred
constraints, and finally annotates each sub-expression with its
inferred type.
When the type inference algorithm visits a function call site,
the function’s type relations are instantiated with the concrete
argument types at the call site. Each instantiated relation is
added to the queue of relations to solve. The relationship between a call’s type variables and relations is added as an edge
to a bipartite dependency graph where the two disjoint sets are
type variables and type relations. Traditional unification constraints are represented using a modified union-find structure
that integrates with this dependency graph.
Once the queue is populated, the algorithm will dequeue
a relation and attempt to solve it. There are two cases when
solving a type relation:
1. If all the relation’s type variables are concrete, we the
relation function. If that function returns true, the constraint
is discharged. Otherwise, type checking fails.
2. If any type is fully or partially symbolic, the algorithm will
propagate existing concrete type information via unification. All relations affected by new assignments to type
variables (as determined by the dependency graph) are
moved to the beginning of the queue. If the current type
relation is now completely solved, we discard it to avoid
unnecessarily visiting it again.
We run this to fixpoint or until the queue is empty. If
the queue is non-empty and no progress is made between iterations, then at least one variable is underconstrained and
inference fails. Note that a type relation’s implementation can
compromise type soundness, as they are axiomatic descriptions of operations implemented outside of Relay. In practice,
the number of type relations needed to express Relay’s operators is small, and their implementations

Can you explain these sections, what are the key takeaways

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — this section is about Relay’s type system, which is one of its most powerful (but subtle) contributions. Let’s unpack this step by step and focus on the key takeaways for your understanding (and for a potential slide deck).

Why the Type System Matters

Relay’s type system isn’t just about checking correctness — it is crucial for optimizations and hardware targeting.

Key reasons:

Static shape information → better memory planning, buffer allocation, loop optimizations.

Static correctness guarantees → catch dimension mismatches early, not at runtime.

Portable lowering → shapes/types guide backend code generation and layout transforms.

1. Shape-Aware Types

Relay introduces a tensor type that is richer than just “float32”:

Includes:

Base type (e.g., float32, int8, bit width, vector lanes).

Shape: A tuple of integers (can be concrete, symbolic, or expressions like n+1).

Shape polymorphism:

Functions can be generic over shapes — meaning the same function can work on tensors of any shape, as long as the constraints hold.

Shapes can be symbolic, enabling Relay to express relationships like “output length = input length + 1” statically.

Special Any shape:

If modeling a shape statically isn’t worth the cost, you can fall back to Any for dynamic shapes (avoids overcomplicating typing).

Key takeaway:

Relay tracks much more precise shape information than traditional computation graphs, enabling aggressive optimizations without burdening the user with full dependent types.

2. Operators and Type Relations

Opaque operators: Relay treats operators (like conv2d, add) as primitives with known type behavior — but doesn’t “inline” their semantics.

Type relations:

A type relation is a meta-function that defines a symbolic relationship between input and output shapes/types.

Example: For broadcast_add(A, B), type relation says “output shape = broadcast(A.shape, B.shape)”.

Extensible: Users can define new operators and attach new type relations, so Relay can still type-check them and propagate shape info.

Key takeaway:

Type relations make Relay’s type system modular and extensible, so you can add new operators without rewriting the compiler’s core type system.

3. Type Inference with Constraint Solving

Relay extends Hindley–Milner type inference (used in ML-family languages like Haskell/OCaml) with shape constraints:

Generate: Walk the AST, assign types and generate type/shape constraints.

Solve: Use a constraint solver to resolve shape relationships and unify type variables.

Annotate: Propagate final concrete types/shapes back into the program.

Special handling:

If all variables in a relation are concrete, it just checks validity.

If some are symbolic, it propagates known info and keeps solving until a fixpoint.

If unsolvable → inference fails with a type error (catching bugs early).

Key takeaway:

Relay automatically infers types and shapes, so users don’t have to manually annotate everything, but the compiler still gets precise shape info for optimizations.

Why This Matters for Optimization

Relay’s type system enables:

Memory planning: Know buffer sizes statically.

Loop optimizations: Loop bounds derived from shape info.

Data layout transformations & tensorization: Choose the best data layout for target hardware (NHWC vs NCHW) at compile time.

Error checking: Catch shape mismatches before deployment.

Can you explain the compiler stack in more detail

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — the Relay compiler stack is one of the most important parts of the paper, and understanding it clearly will make your presentation much stronger. Let’s go step by step and unpack what happens at each stage.

Relay Compiler Stack – Detailed Walkthrough

Think of the Relay compiler stack as a three-stage pipeline that takes a high-level model and turns it into highly optimized code for a specific hardware backend. Here’s what happens in each stage:

1. Frontend / Import Stage

Goal: Convert an external model into Relay IR.

Inputs: Models from TensorFlow, PyTorch (via TorchScript), MXNet, or ONNX.

Process:

The model’s computation graph is parsed and lowered into Relay IR.

All layers, operators, and parameters are converted into Relay’s functional, type-checked representation.

Relay performs type checking and shape inference at this point, ensuring the imported model is well-formed.

Output: A single, whole-program Relay IR that captures the entire model’s computation.

Key point: This step normalizes models from different frameworks into a common, analyzable representation.

2. Relay IR Optimization Stage

Goal: Transform and optimize the Relay IR for performance and correctness.

This is where the bulk of Relay’s advantages show up. It applies:

Type Inference & Shape Analysis: Deduce all tensor shapes to enable memory planning and verify correctness.

Operator Fusion: Merge compatible operations into a single kernel to reduce memory traffic and kernel launch overhead.

Quantization Passes: Annotate and rewrite parts of the program to use lower-precision datatypes.

Partial Evaluation: Precompute subexpressions that are constant at compile-time (e.g., constant folding).

Automatic Differentiation: (If training) Generate gradient code directly in Relay IR.

This step is hardware-agnostic — it just makes the program itself more efficient.

3. Backend / Code Generation Stage

Goal: Turn the optimized IR into hardware-specific code.

Lowering: Relay’s operators are lowered into TVM compute expressions (TVM’s lower-level IR).

Scheduling: TVM chooses the best scheduling strategy — tiling, unrolling, vectorization — based on the target hardware (CPU, GPU, accelerator).

Codegen: Generate machine code or invoke vendor libraries (e.g., cuDNN, MKL-DNN) for maximum performance.

Runtime Packaging: Bundle compiled kernels + execution runtime for deployment.

Big Picture

The stack provides:

Frontend portability: Import from many model formats.

Middle-end optimizations: Whole-program view for aggressive optimizations.

Backend portability: Target CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs without changing the model.

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**You:**



* * *

**You:**

Can you explain the relay quantization framework

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — Relay’s quantization framework is one of its most interesting contributions, because it’s designed to be composable, general, and IR-level rather than tied to specific operators or hardware. Let’s break it down step by step.

1. Problem with Quantization in Existing Frameworks

Before Relay, quantization was usually:

Ad hoc and framework-specific: Each framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet) had its own way of doing quantization.

Operator-centric: You had to write a new quantized kernel for every (operator × bit-width × datatype) combination.

Not composable: Quantization had to be applied before or after other optimizations, often breaking fusion or requiring special passes.

Limited strategy support: Only a handful of quantization strategies (e.g. int8 linear quantization) were supported.

This meant:

Hard to experiment with new quantization strategies (mixed precision, per-channel quantization).

Hard to reuse quantization logic across backends.

2. Relay’s Solution: An IR-Level Quantization Framework

Relay treats quantization as a program transformation, not a separate kernel library.
This means:

Quantization happens at the Relay IR level, where the whole program is still visible.

The framework is extensible — you can add new quantization schemes by defining transformation rules, not by writing new operator kernels for every case.

3. Three-Phase Quantization Flow

Relay implements quantization as a three-phase process:

Phase 1: Annotate

Walk the Relay program and mark which parts should be quantized.

Insert fake-quantize nodes (also called “annotation ops”) that record desired datatypes and bit-widths.

This stage is purely symbolic — no actual rounding or scaling happens yet.

Can be automated (apply to entire network) or selective (apply only to some layers).

Phase 2: Calibrate

Run the annotated program with representative data.

Collect statistics (e.g., min/max range, histogram of activations) to compute scale factors and zero-points for each tensor.

These calibration parameters will later be baked into the transformed program.

Phase 3: Realize

Rewrite the Relay IR to replace floating-point operators with quantized equivalents.

Insert dequantize and requantize operators only where needed (e.g., boundaries).

Fold quantization parameters (scale/zero-point) into constants so runtime cost is minimal.

At this point, the program is ready for backend-specific lowering.

4. Benefits

Relay’s approach yields several benefits:

Composable: Can be combined with other Relay passes (operator fusion, partial evaluation, etc.).

Extensible: Users can define custom quantization rules, e.g., per-channel quantization, symmetric quantization.

Portable: Because quantization happens at IR level, the lowered program can be retargeted to CPUs, GPUs, or accelerators without rewriting the quantization logic.

Optimizable: The compiler can still fuse quantized operators together, eliminating unnecessary dequantize/requantize nodes.

Slide Deck Summary

Bullets:

Three steps:

Annotate: Mark quantization regions.

Calibrate: Collect scale/zero-point with sample data.

Composable with other optimizations (fusion, partial eval).

Extensible to new datatypes, bit-widths, and strategies.

* * *

**You:**

What is the advantage of this quantization strategy

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — the advantage of Relay’s IR-level, three-phase quantization strategy is that it solves many of the problems that earlier frameworks faced. Let’s break down the key benefits:

1. Composability

Problem before: Quantization often had to be applied as a special mode before or after other passes. This could prevent optimizations like operator fusion, or force developers to hand-write fused quantized kernels.

Relay advantage:

Quantization is expressed as annotations + transformations on the IR, so it can be scheduled alongside other passes.

The compiler can still perform fusion and dead code elimination on the quantized graph.

Avoids redundant dequantize → quantize conversions between ops (because they can be removed by optimizations).

2. Extensibility & Experimentation

Problem before: Supporting a new quantization strategy required implementing kernels for every (operator × datatype × bit-width × backend) combination — a combinatorial explosion.

Relay advantage:

You only define rules for rewriting operators into quantized versions + how to insert quantize/dequantize.

You can easily try new strategies (per-channel, symmetric/asymmetric, mixed precision) without touching kernel code.

Great for research — faster iteration on quantization techniques.

3. Portability

Problem before: Quantized models often had to be reimplemented or adjusted per backend (ARM CPU, GPU, accelerator).

Relay advantage:

Once the Relay IR is quantized, TVM lowering handles backend-specific codegen.

The same quantized model can target CPU, GPU, FPGA, or custom accelerators.

4. Precision & Efficiency

Calibrate step benefit: By running the model once with representative data, Relay chooses scale factors and zero-points that minimize quantization error.

Realize step benefit: Only inserts quantization where necessary, avoids wasteful conversions, and folds constants — producing a clean, efficient graph.

5. Whole-Program Awareness

Because quantization is applied at the IR level:

Relay has a global view of the model — can reason about which parts benefit most from quantization.

Enables selective quantization (e.g., quantize conv layers but leave sensitive layers like softmax in float32).

Summary Table
Traditional Approach	Relay Quantization Advantage
Kernel-by-kernel implementation	IR-level transformation → easy to maintain & extend
Breaks fusion (needs special quantized fused ops)	Compatible with other Relay optimizations (fusion, partial eval)
Limited quantization modes supported	Extensible to new strategies and datatypes
Rewritten per-backend	Single quantized IR → portable across backends
Harder to experiment	Ideal for research — just rewrite rules, no kernel re-implementation
Key Takeaway

Relay’s quantization framework is cleaner, more modular, and more future-proof:

It lets you quantize once, optimize globally, and deploy anywhere, without rewriting operators or giving up performance.

Would you like me to put together a diagram contrasting “Old Approach” vs “Relay Approach” (e.g., left side shows separate quantized kernels per backend, right side shows single IR-level quantization pass feeding into multiple backends)? That would really make the advantage visually clear for a slide.

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s a clean, slide-ready summary of the advantages of Relay’s quantization framework:

Advantages of Relay Quantization

Composable: Works at the IR level, allowing fusion, partial evaluation, and other optimizations even after quantization.

Extensible: Easy to add new quantization strategies (e.g., per-channel, mixed precision) without rewriting operator kernels.

Portable: Same quantized IR can target CPU, GPU, or accelerators — backend-specific code is generated automatically.

Efficient: Minimizes redundant quantize/dequantize conversions and folds constants for faster inference.

Accurate: Uses calibration to pick scale factors and zero-points that minimize quantization error.

Research-Friendly: Great for experimentation — developers only write transformation rules, not backend-specific kernels.
